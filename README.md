## 📋 Project Overview

**agilebot_isaac_sim** is the simulation integration repository in the Agilebot Robot Isaac ecosystem, providing a complete solution for integrating Agilebot series robots into NVIDIA IsaacSim simulation environment, including core control code, motion policy configurations, and rich example demonstrations.

This project is developed and maintained by [Shanghai Agilebot Robotics Ltd.](https://www.sh-agilebot.com/). Agilebot is a high-tech enterprise specializing in industrial robot R&D, manufacturing, and intelligent manufacturing solutions. With proprietary **Single-Chip Multi-Axis Drive-Control Integrated Motion Controller (SCIMC)** technology at its core, Agilebot provides high-performance, cost-effective, and user-friendly robot products and intelligent manufacturing solutions for various industries.

### ✨ Key Features

- 🦾 **Multi-Model Support**: Supports multiple Agilebot robot models including gbt-c5a, gbt-c7a, gbt-c12a, gbt-c16a
- 🎮 **RMPflow Motion Control**: Integrated RMPflow (Robot Motion Policy Flow) motion policy framework
- 🎯 **Rich Function Demos**: Complete task examples including target following, pick-and-place, stacking
- 🔧 **MoveIt Integration**: Support for robot control through ROS 2 + MoveIt
- 📷 **Vision Grasping**: Wrist-mounted camera integrated grasping task implementation
- 🔍 **Kinematics Verification**: Forward/inverse kinematics verification tools

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- NVIDIA IsaacSim (latest version recommended)
- Python 3.11+
- Robot USD model files ([Download Link](https://github.com/sh-agilebot/agilebot_isaac_usd_assets/tree/main))

> 📖 For detailed installation and configuration instructions, see **[Isaac Sim Environment Configuration Guide](./docs/isaacsim_environment_setup.md)**

### Installation Configuration

#### 1. Configure RMPflow Motion Policy

Copy the `motion_policy_configs/Agilebot` directory to your IsaacSim configuration directory:

```bash
cp -r agilebot_integration/motion_policy_configs/Agilebot \
  ~/isaacsim/exts/isaacsim.robot_motion.motion_generation/motion_policy_configs/
```

#### 2. Configure Agilebot Integration Code

Copy the `code/agilebot` directory to your IsaacSim extensions directory:

```bash
cp -r agilebot_integration/code/agilebot \
  ~/isaacsim/exts/isaacsim.robot.manipulators.examples/isaacsim/robot/manipulators/examples/
```

> ⚠️ **Note**: This path may cause package prefix conflicts in VS Code, preventing code hints. Users can adjust the path according to actual needs.

#### 3. Prepare Robot USD Files

Download robot USD model files from the [agilebot_isaac_usd_assets](https://github.com/sh-agilebot/agilebot_isaac_usd_assets) repository and place them in the specified path, then configure the correct USD path in the demo files.

> 💡 **Isaac Asset Setup Tip**: For Isaac Sim asset caching configuration, please refer to [Isaac Sim Official Documentation - Setup Tips - Asset](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/installation/install_faq.html#setup-tips) section.

Supported robot models:
- gbt-c5a
- gbt-c7a
- gbt-c12a
- gbt-c16a

## 💡 Advanced Tips

### Completely Independent Project Setup

> 💡 **Tip**: If you want your project to run completely independently without relying on copying code to the Isaac Sim installation directory, you can refer to the implementation of the **[Camera Grasping Example](./example/pick_place_agilebot_camera_gripper)**:
>
> 1. **Localize Configuration Files**: Copy the required `motion_policy_configs` configuration files to your project's local directory (like `rmpflow/` in the example)
> 2. **Copy Core Code**: Copy core classes from `agilebot_integration/code/agilebot/` (controllers, tasks, etc.) to your project's local directory (like `controllers/` and `tasks/` in the example)
> 3. **Adjust Import Paths**: Modify Python import statements to use local relative paths instead of Isaac Sim extension paths
>
> Benefits of this approach:
> - ✅ Complete project independence for easier version control and team collaboration
> - ✅ No dependency on specific Isaac Sim installation paths
> - ✅ Easier deployment and migration
> - ✅ Avoid package path conflicts causing code hint issues

### Isaac Sim GUI Unresponsive Issue

> 💡 **Tip**: If the Isaac Sim GUI is unresponsive and there are no error messages, this is usually because resources are being loaded from the network. Please ensure your network connection is stable, or use a VPN to accelerate the resource loading process. It is recommended to set up Isaac Sim's resource path in advance to avoid delays caused by network resource loading.
